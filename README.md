hi, i'm ray/spence :-) you're probably here from ponytown so here's some info byi
- i'm usually off tab or not paying attention so if you want to interact whisper me
- i have a hard time socializing for many reasons. i may come off overly formal or awkward if we're not close, and would prefer if others initiate conversation rather than me. i may randomly stop talking because i get overwhelmed and burnt out by 1:1 conversation very easily so don't take it personally if i randomly go silent. i have trouble talking about things that aren't my interests if we're not close.
- speaking of my interests! as of writing this, i'm really into little shop of horrors, ghostbusters, reanimator, talking heads, oingo boingo, cd and dvd collecting, and a LOT more. you can find a more exstensive list here: rentry.co/audreyii
- i don't care if you copy my skins or cuddle me or whatever just don't flirt with me or generally be weird
- i don't really have a dni, i'll just walk away from you if i don't like you.
- PLEEEASE INTERACT IF WE HAVE INTERESTS IN COMMON!! I LOVE TALKING TO NEW PEOPLE ABOUT THEM, THEY ALL MAKE ME VERY HAPPY ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE OBSCURE
- i have dyslexia and bad hand-eye coordination, which may affect my spelling, reading, and typing speed

i think that's all you need to know!! i'll update this if needed, but overall Yeah üëç that's about it
