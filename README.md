hi, i'm ray/spence :-) you're probably here from ponytown so here's some info byi
- i have trouble socializing for many reasons. i may stop replying to you in conversation if i get overwhelmed, and i'm usually pretty unenthusiastic unless i'm talking about my interets.
- speaking of my interests! as of writing this, i'm very into little shop of horrors, ghostbusters, reanimator, talking heads, oingo boingo, cd and dvd collecting, and a LOT more. you can find a more exstensive list here: rentry.co/audreyii
- i don't care if you copy my skins or cuddle me or whatever just don't flirt with me or generally be weird
- i don't like a lot of medias and fandoms so if i don't want to interact with you for that reason i'll ignore you or tell you straight up. i also don't like proshippers, you all are weird and gross
- PLEEEASE INTERACT IF WE HAVE INTERESTS IN COMMON!! I LOVE TALKING TO NEW PEOPLE ABOUT THEM, THEY ALL MAKE ME VERY HAPPY ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE OBSCURE

i think that's all you need to know!! i'll update this if needed, but overall Yeah üëç that's about it
