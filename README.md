Hi, this is just info about me for ponytown!

DNI since i know that's what you came here for:
- proshippers
- bigoted in any way
- engage in cringe culture
- you're against self-diagnosis (with research). i can explain why i advocate for self-diagnosis if you have genuine questions, but i won't reply if you say anything weird or condecending
- and that's basically it. otherwise i'll just hide you

about me:
My name is Ray or Jeremy but you can call me RJ, i don't care. i use he/him mainly but idm she/her. i'm nonbinary and a butch lesbian

i'm autistic (and many other unlisted stuff) and that affects how i may interact with people. i also have chronic pain and fatigue. it's hard for me to keep up small talk or very long conversations unless we're close

interests:
- musical theatre (in general)
- theology
- cds/dvds (i collect them ask me about me collection or tell me about yours Please)
- and more, just talk to me and ill probably bring something up :^]
