hi, read this if you're from ponytown! my name is ray/jeremy but you can also call me rj. i mainly use he/him pronouns but she/her is alright too. i'm nonbinary, genderqueer, and a butch lesbian. i have a bunch of Mental Stuff that i'm not gonna list but i might bring them up in conversation and it affects my behavior. i also have chronic pain and fatigue, which may cause me to leave randomly and be inactive for long periods of time. sorry!

you probably came for my DNI, so here it is. i'll usually just hide you, but some of this stuff i can't just see from your skin or profile, so:
- proshippers
- bigots of any kind (obviously)
- able-bodied ride the cyclone fans
- dsmp/modern mcyter fans
- you have fonts on your profile and/or a hard-to-read typing quirk
- you're really negative or judgy about every little thing
- you're against reality checking (obviously don't do it to random people but like also saying reality checking is inherently bad is anti-recovery and encourages people's delusions)


anyways that's basically it for that. my boundaries outside of that are simple, just don't flirt with me/make sexual gestures towards me/generally be weird.


i have a lot of interests but my main one right now is be more chill (as you could tell). i love musical theatre in general though! i also collect cds and dvds.
